// T maintains mapping of workers that generate requests to executors. An
// executor is associated with a particular Kafka broker. It aggregates worker
// requests, marshals them to a Kafka protocol packet, sends the packet to the
// associated broker, waits for response and fans replies out to the workers.
// An external resolver is used to determine worker to broker-executor
// assignments.
//
// Mapper triggers reassignment whenever one of the following events happen:
//   * it is signaled that a new worker has been spawned via `OnWorkerSpawned()`;
//   * it is signaled that an existing worker has stopped via `OnWorkerStopped()`;
//   * a worker explicitly requested reassignment via `TriggerReassign()`
//   * an executor reported connection error via `BrokerFailed()`.
//
// Executors are spawned on demand when a broker is resolved to a worker for
// the first time. It is guaranteed that a executor is stopped only after all
// workers that used to be assigned to it have either been stopped or assigned
// another to other executors.
